# RoboKings - WRO Future Engineers 2024: Autonomous Self Driving Car

## Team: 
RoboKings (Pakistan)

## Project Overview
Welcome to the RoboKings' journey in the WRO Future Engineers 2024 competition! We are a passionate trio from Pakistan dedicated to creating a self-driving elf car capable of navigating a designated track and completing three laps autonomously. This project embodies our commitment to robotics, innovation, and pushing the boundaries of intelligent vehicles.

## Challenge
This year's WRO challenge focuses on developing an autonomous elf delivery car. The car must successfully traverse a pre-defined track, mimicking Santa's trusty elf helpers. The RoboKings' car will need to:

- **Navigate autonomously:** Employ deep learning techniques and sensor fusion to perceive its surroundings, make real-time decisions, and maneuver the car without human intervention.
- **Complete three laps:** Demonstrate consistent performance by navigating the entire track three times, showcasing the car's reliability and accuracy.

## Technical Specifications
To conquer the WRO challenge, we have assembled a powerful hardware and software stack:

### Hardware
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano:** Provides processing power for complex deep learning algorithms.
- **LiDAR Sensor:** Creates a 3D map of the environment for precise navigation and obstacle detection.
- **2-3 Raspberry Pi Cameras:** Capture visual data for object detection and path planning.
- **RC Car Chassis:** The base for our autonomous elf car.

### Software
- **C++:** Forms the core of our development.
- **Open-Source Libraries:** We'll utilize established deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for training our autonomous model.

## Project Structure
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guides on project goals, setup, design choices, etc.
- **Code:** Well-structured C++ code with comments and best practices.
- **Data:** Training data for the deep learning model.
- **3D Design Files (Optional):** Files used for customized parts or modifications.

## Collaboration and Contribution
We welcome collaboration! Reach out to us through discussions, pull requests, or issues to share your expertise and help us improve our project.

**Disclaimer:** We may not be able to disclose certain implementation details to safeguard our competitive edge.

## Community Engagement
We plan to actively participate in the WRO community by sharing our progress, documenting lessons learned, and potentially providing tutorials or workshops to inspire fellow teams.

## Stay Tuned!
This repository is a work in progress, and we'll continue to update it with our ongoing development efforts. Feel free to follow our progress and join us on this exciting journey as we conquer the WRO Future Engineers 2024 challenge!
