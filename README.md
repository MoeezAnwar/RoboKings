# RoboKings - WRO Future Engineers 2024: Autonomous Self Driving Car
## Team: 
RoboKings (Pakistan)

## Project Overview
We're the RoboKings, a passionate team from Pakistan on a mission to conquer the WRO Future Engineers 2024 challenge by building a fully autonomous self-driving car! Inspired by the magic of Santa's industrious elves, our car is designed to navigate a designated track and complete three laps without human intervention. This project embodies our commitment to robotics, innovation, and the future of intelligent transportation.

### The WRO Challenge and Our Focus
The WRO Future Engineers category emphasizes the entire engineering process. Teams earn points for their final product and for documenting their journey within a public GitHub repository. This year's exciting challenge features a randomly changing track, testing our car's adaptability!

We're focusing on these key areas to build our autonomous car:

- **Sensor Fusion and Computer Vision:** We'll use LiDAR, cameras, and computer vision to give our car a real-time understanding of its surroundings.
- **Open-Source Hardware:** We're building with readily available components like a Jetson Nano, an RC chassis, and the Adafruit Motor Shield.
- **Action Planning and Kinematic Control:** Sophisticated algorithms will enable the car to make decisions and execute maneuvers beyond simple differential drive.
- **Optimization for Stability:** Our goal is to create a consistently reliable car capable of navigating the various track layouts.
- **Teamwork and Documentation:** Strong collaboration, communication, and a detailed engineering journal will be critical to our success.
